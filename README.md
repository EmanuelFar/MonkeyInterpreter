# Monkey Language Interpreter in Go

This repository contains an implementation of the Monkey programming language interpreter written in Go. The interpreter is based on the book [*Writing an Interpreter in Go*](https://interpreterbook.com/) and follows the concepts and structure presented in the book.

## Overview

The Monkey interpreter is built using a combination of lexical analysis, parsing, and evaluation. The main components include:

- **Lexer**: Responsible for tokenizing the input source code.
- **Parser**: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens generated by the lexer.
- **AST**: Represents the structure of the program.
- **Evaluation**: Executes the AST to produce the desired output. --> not configured yet.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Support for basic arithmetic operations, including `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `<`, `>`, `==`, and `!=`.
- **Variable Bindings**: Bind values to variables using the `let` keyword.
- **Function Declarations**: Define functions using the `fn` keyword.
- **Conditional Statements**: Execute conditional logic with `if` and `else` statements.
- **Return Statements**: Return values from functions using the `return` keyword.

## Example
```
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let result = x + y;
return result;
```
